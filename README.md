# AutoHotkey - Syntax Package for Sublime Text 2/3
AutoHotkey language package for SublimeText including syntax highlighting, comments toggling, autocompletions, build system definitions, and commands for ahkrunpiped, ahkrun, ahkcompile.

The ahkrunpiped command will run the code in the current buffer by piping it as a temporary string to the AutoHotkey.exe executable. This enables you to run and test AutoHotkey scripts without needing to save them to a file first.

For the build system and ahkrun, ahkrunpiped, and ahkcompile commands, if you have a non-default installation then you will need to set your specific path to AutoHotkey.exe and Ahk2Exe.exe in a file named AutoHotkey.sublime-settings in your User folder. You can access these settings file from the Menu `Preferences > Package Settings > AutoHotkey`. You should make a copy of `AutoHotkey Settings - Default` at `AutoHotkey Settings - User` since then your settings file in your User folder will not get overwritten when this package updates.

## Key Bindings
If you have the default Sublime keybindings intact, then:
* <kbd>Ctrl+B</kbd> will run the current file (with AutoHotkey.exe)
* <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd> will compile the current file (with Ahk2Exe.exe)
