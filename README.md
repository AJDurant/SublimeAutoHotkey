AutoHotkey - Syntax Package for Sublime Text 2/3
==========

AutoHotkey language package for SublimeText including syntax highlighting, comments toggling, autocompletions, and an ahkexec command.

The ahkexec command will run the code in the current buffer by piping it as a temporary string to the AutoHotkey.exe executable. This enables you to run and test AutoHotkey scripts without needing to save them to a file first. The location of your AutoHotkey.exe executable will need to be set in AutoHotkey.sublime-settings.
