AutoHotkey
==========

AutoHotkey language package for SublimeText includes syntax highlighting, comments, autocompletions, and an ahkexec command to run the current code in the buffer without the need to save the file.

If the location of your AutoHotkey.exe executable is not "C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" then you will need to set it at the top of ahkexec.py
